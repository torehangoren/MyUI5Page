		University in Istanbul in February 2019. Currently, I am working at TGW Logistics Group Company in 
		Austria as an ABAP and Fiori Developer.
		In my 4 year SAP career, I worked 2 years of it in a consulting company in turkey in the F/CO/RE 
		modules and until 2019/April. Now I work in Austria in the EWM module as an ABAP/Fiori Developer. 
		These different environments  where I worked gave me a different perspective, and I was able to 
		gather work disciplines in different countries.
		Since there are no ready EWM applications  in Fiori library to meet the needs of our customers,  we designed our custom applications. 
		Here I voluntarily learned Javascript and I carried out all the planning deveIoping related to fiori alone." />
