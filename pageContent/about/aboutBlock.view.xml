			text="I was born in Turkey in 1991, i spent part of my youth in Kiel, Germany. After returning to Turkey, I studied German Language Teaching at the University. 
			During this time, I decided to concentrate on software development, which I was engaged in as a hobby, and therefore I decided to study Business Informatics at Marmara University Istanbul.
			While I was d oing my Master's in 2016, I got a job as an ABAP Developer. 
			After successfully completing the university and with the experience I gained as ABAP Developer, I came to Austria.
			The Job that I started as ABAP Developer at TGW Logistic I am continuing now as Fiori Developer.
			As I am keen on learning new things, I took over the Fiori development and have designed many different custom screens from zero for EWM so far." />
